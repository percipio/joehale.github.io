Welcome to my new website. I'm excited to have finally had some time to sit down and code a new site using [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've been programming in Ruby on Rails for a while now and I really like this platform so far. I wanted to build something that was lightweight and didn't rely on a complex backend or database so `Jekyll` is perfect for my needs right now. I've been pretty interested in putting together a new blogging platform but haven't really had the time.

It's now nearly complete, I just need to import all blog posts, which could take a while since I'm going to write my own script in Python to do it - and I'm just learning the language.

Most of what I do, I do to learn, so I wanted to learn to program in Python so now I try to do most tasks in the language.

Good times, but it can take me longer because I also work full time and love hangin out with my family, cooking, and playing video games.

So hang in there, more to come.
