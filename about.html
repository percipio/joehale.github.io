        <h1 class="title text-center">Who Am I?</h1>
        <p class="intro text-center">I'm a lot of things. A husband and father. A self-taught programmer. A technical program manager. An aspiring writer. A life-long learner.</p>
        <p>I've lived in a town south-west of Seattle, across the Puget Sound by the name of Gig Harbor for about two years now. It's beautiful in the summer and rainy in the winter, like everywhere else in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>I love to learn. In fact, after I earned my Master's Degree, I thought I was done going to school but it didn't take me long to feel the draw back to an academic environment. I decided, however, that I didn't want to pursue a PhD or go back to school in the traditional sense so I started taking courses with Udacity.</p>
        <p>Udacity is an awesome learning platform where the courses are short, about the lenght of a college semester. They cost a fraction of the tuition of a single college course. And, they're easy to fit into my busy full-time job.</p>
        <p>Right now I'm learning <strong>AI Programming with Python.</strong></p>
        <p>So far I've finished the intro to Python module and am starting my image classification lab.</p>
